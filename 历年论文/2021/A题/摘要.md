## GAME：真菌生活策略和生物多样性的先知 基于高斯模型的生物多样性

Decomposition of organic matters by fungi, an indispensable part of carbon cycle, carmake carbon reused in the environment. A recent article explores the impact of differenraits on its decomposition effeciency. In this paper, we focus on two main traits, hyphaextension rate and moisture tolerance, together with interactions among fungi and variou.environmental conditions, to simulate the breakdown of woody fibers and comprehend themportance of biodiversity.


真菌对有机物的分解是碳循环不可或缺的部分，有机物的分解使碳得以在环境中循环再利用。最近的一篇文章探讨了不同特征对分解效率的影响。在这篇论文中，我们关注两个主要特征，即菌丝延伸速率和湿度耐受性，以及真菌与各种环境条件之间的相互作用，以模拟木质纤维的降解过程并理解生物多样性的重要性。

Our GAME model is made up of the initials of four task names. Before we start our experiments, we build up a prediction model to simulate the cross action among different fungand their effect on the decomposition process of woody fibers. We adopt Gause's Competitive Model to uncover the interactions among species and derive a differential system bconsidering the change of woody fibers amount. The model describes growth, hyphal ex
tension, competition, and decomposition of fungi.

我们的GAME模型由四个任务名称的首字母组成。在开始实验之前，我们建立了一个预测模型，模拟不同真菌之间的相互作用以及它们对木质纤维分解过程的影响。我们采用高斯竞争模型来揭示物种之间的相互作用，并通过考虑木质纤维数量的变化推导出一个微分系统。该模型描述了真菌的生长、菌丝延伸、竞争和分解过程。

Firstly, in order to simplify the model, we fix temperature T' = 22 C, and set the traioarameters of three different fungi artificially. Experiment results shown that our model isof high reasonability since the predicted decomposition rate is nearly 30%, which approximately equals to verified research results.

首先，为了简化模型，我们将温度T'固定为22摄氏度，并人为设置了三种不同真菌的参数。实验结果表明我们的模型具有很高的合理性，因为预测的分解率几乎为30%，这与已验证的研究结果相近。

Secondly, we are to choose five representitive fungi as our experiment objects, which arePFlavidoalba.S., PHartigii.N, M.Tremellosus.N, PSangioneusS, and H.Setigerum.Nrespectively. After describing their typical characteristics, we introduce the Moisture/Temperature Tolerance Factor for calibrating. Based on the model proposed, we find that thespecies P.Flavidoalba.S. is always dominant at Columbus (temperate) in short-term (7 days) and long-term (122 days), due to its general advantage on moisture. Also, rapid fluctuatiorexperiment indicates those who adapt the environment well will be in dominance.

其次，我们选择五种代表性的真菌作为实验对象，它们分别是P.Flavidoalba.S.、P.Hartigii.N、M.Tremellosus.N、P.SangioneusS和H.Setigerum.N。在描述它们的典型特征后，我们引入了湿度/温度耐受因子进行校准。根据所提出的模型，我们发现在哥伦布（温带）短期（7天）和长期（122天）内，物种P.Flavidoalba.S.始终占优势，这是由于其在湿度方面的普遍优势。此外，快速波动实验表明适应环境的物种将占主导地位。

Thirdly, we choose five cities, Santa Fe (Arid), Sioux Falls (semi-arid), Columbus (temperate), Atlanta (arboreal), and Codajas (rain forest), and do the same prediction on theprevious step. The result shows that, except for the leading fungus PFlavidoalba.S., othespecies' density gradually decrease, but never tend to 0. Additionally, PFlavidoalba.SPSangioneusS, M.Tremellosus.N. will have a consistent competition in tropical rain forest, since they have their unique advantages in this environment. The decomposition ratewill be relatively better for higher temperature and moisture to some extent.

第三，我们选择五个城市，圣菲（干旱）、苏福尔斯（半干旱）、哥伦布（温带）、亚特兰大（森林）和科达哈斯（雨林），并在前一步骤上进行相同的预测。结果显示，除了领先的真菌P.Flavidoalba.S.外，其他物种的密度逐渐减少，但从未趋近于0。此外，P.Flavidoalba.S.、P.SangioneusS、M.Tremellosus.N.在热带雨林中将保持一致的竞争，因为它们在这个环境中具有独特的优势。在一定程度上，更高的温度和湿度对分解率相对较好。

Fourthly, we explore the decomposition efficiency of the system by changing the numberof fungus, and discover that they actually have positive correlation in all areas. Moreover, itis shown that compared with arid region, tropical rain forest will have a higher requiremenfor biodiversity since it has a relatively stable climate.

第四，我们通过改变真菌的数量来探讨系统的分解效率，发现它们在所有区域实际上都有正相关性。此外，与干旱地区相比，热带雨林对生物多样性有较高的要求，因为它具有相对稳定的气候。

After modelling, we also conduct sensitivity analysis, which reveals our model's robustness to some parameters. We finally summarize our strengths and weaknesses. A brieconclusion is also presented in the paper.

建模后，我们还进行了敏感性分析，揭示了我们模型对一些参数的稳健性。最后，我们总结了模型的优势和劣势，并在论文中提出了简要的结论。

# 2.A Simulation Based Modelling of Multiple Fungal Ecosystems (2101951) 
## 基于模拟的多种真菌生态系统

This work has established a Multiple Fungal Model to analyze the breakdown of ground litter and woody fibers through fungal activity in different ecosystems, and uses this model to investigate the importance of biodiversity in different environments.

For Problem 1, we first distinguish the factors that directly impact the decomposition rate (𝐷𝑅), i.e. temperature, moisture and the biomass of the fungi from those indirect ones, e.g., environmental capability and competition factor. Then we establish an improved logistic competition model to obtain a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of decomposition rate and fungal biomass growth, each of which represents the direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem of fungal communities.

For Problem 2, we apply Lustenhouwer et al.’s data into our model to quantify the factors that defined in the model and to determine the effect of hyphal extension rate (𝐸𝑅) and moisture tolerance (𝑀𝑇) on the simulation results. When we analyze the factors’ impact on the result of the experiment, hypothesis testing method is used to determine the explicit expression of the differential equations and to obtain the values of each coefficients. To simulate the dynamics of the growth of fungi and the mass loss of organic compounds, we used numerical integrations as our ODEs are non-integrable. Our simulated 𝐷𝑅 − 𝐸𝑅 curve is in a good agreement with Figure 1C of Lustenhouwer et al’s work. We find that 𝑀𝑇 is approximately inversely proportional to 𝐸𝑅, where the slope is -0.154 and the intercept is 2.96. Applying this correlation into our model, we could conclude that when multiple fungal species were competing in one system, the one with medium extension rate are likely to outcompete the others in the long-term.

For Problem 3, we use the expression of the Multiple Fungal Ecosystem Model that are derived from Problem 2 to run simulation. After dividing the factors into fungal traits, competition factors and weather variation, qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis methods are used to analyze each factors’ impact on the ecosystem in both short- and long- term. Below are our key conclusions:
