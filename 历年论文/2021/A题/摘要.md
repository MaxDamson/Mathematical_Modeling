## GAME：真菌生活策略和生物多样性的先知 基于高斯模型的生物多样性

Decomposition of organic matters by fungi, an indispensable part of carbon cycle, carmake carbon reused in the environment. A recent article explores the impact of differenraits on its decomposition effeciency. In this paper, we focus on two main traits, hyphaextension rate and moisture tolerance, together with interactions among fungi and variou.environmental conditions, to simulate the breakdown of woody fibers and comprehend themportance of biodiversity.


真菌对有机物的分解是碳循环不可或缺的部分，有机物的分解使碳得以在环境中循环再利用。最近的一篇文章探讨了不同特征对分解效率的影响。在这篇论文中，我们关注两个主要特征，即菌丝延伸速率和湿度耐受性，以及真菌与各种环境条件之间的相互作用，以模拟木质纤维的降解过程并理解生物多样性的重要性。

Our GAME model is made up of the initials of four task names. Before we start our experiments, we build up a prediction model to simulate the cross action among different fungand their effect on the decomposition process of woody fibers. We adopt Gause's Competitive Model to uncover the interactions among species and derive a differential system bconsidering the change of woody fibers amount. The model describes growth, hyphal ex
tension, competition, and decomposition of fungi.

我们的GAME模型由四个任务名称的首字母组成。在开始实验之前，我们建立了一个预测模型，模拟不同真菌之间的相互作用以及它们对木质纤维分解过程的影响。我们采用高斯竞争模型来揭示物种之间的相互作用，并通过考虑木质纤维数量的变化推导出一个微分系统。该模型描述了真菌的生长、菌丝延伸、竞争和分解过程。

Firstly, in order to simplify the model, we fix temperature T' = 22 C, and set the traioarameters of three different fungi artificially. Experiment results shown that our model isof high reasonability since the predicted decomposition rate is nearly 30%, which approximately equals to verified research results.

首先，为了简化模型，我们将温度T'固定为22摄氏度，并人为设置了三种不同真菌的参数。实验结果表明我们的模型具有很高的合理性，因为预测的分解率几乎为30%，这与已验证的研究结果相近。

Secondly, we are to choose five representitive fungi as our experiment objects, which arePFlavidoalba.S., PHartigii.N, M.Tremellosus.N, PSangioneusS, and H.Setigerum.Nrespectively. After describing their typical characteristics, we introduce the Moisture/Temperature Tolerance Factor for calibrating. Based on the model proposed, we find that thespecies P.Flavidoalba.S. is always dominant at Columbus (temperate) in short-term (7 days) and long-term (122 days), due to its general advantage on moisture. Also, rapid fluctuatiorexperiment indicates those who adapt the environment well will be in dominance.

其次，我们选择五种代表性的真菌作为实验对象，它们分别是P.Flavidoalba.S.、P.Hartigii.N、M.Tremellosus.N、P.SangioneusS和H.Setigerum.N。在描述它们的典型特征后，我们引入了湿度/温度耐受因子进行校准。根据所提出的模型，我们发现在哥伦布（温带）短期（7天）和长期（122天）内，物种P.Flavidoalba.S.始终占优势，这是由于其在湿度方面的普遍优势。此外，快速波动实验表明适应环境的物种将占主导地位。

Thirdly, we choose five cities, Santa Fe (Arid), Sioux Falls (semi-arid), Columbus (temperate), Atlanta (arboreal), and Codajas (rain forest), and do the same prediction on theprevious step. The result shows that, except for the leading fungus PFlavidoalba.S., othespecies' density gradually decrease, but never tend to 0. Additionally, PFlavidoalba.SPSangioneusS, M.Tremellosus.N. will have a consistent competition in tropical rain forest, since they have their unique advantages in this environment. The decomposition ratewill be relatively better for higher temperature and moisture to some extent.

第三，我们选择五个城市，圣菲（干旱）、苏福尔斯（半干旱）、哥伦布（温带）、亚特兰大（森林）和科达哈斯（雨林），并在前一步骤上进行相同的预测。结果显示，除了领先的真菌P.Flavidoalba.S.外，其他物种的密度逐渐减少，但从未趋近于0。此外，P.Flavidoalba.S.、P.SangioneusS、M.Tremellosus.N.在热带雨林中将保持一致的竞争，因为它们在这个环境中具有独特的优势。在一定程度上，更高的温度和湿度对分解率相对较好。

Fourthly, we explore the decomposition efficiency of the system by changing the numberof fungus, and discover that they actually have positive correlation in all areas. Moreover, itis shown that compared with arid region, tropical rain forest will have a higher requiremenfor biodiversity since it has a relatively stable climate.

第四，我们通过改变真菌的数量来探讨系统的分解效率，发现它们在所有区域实际上都有正相关性。此外，与干旱地区相比，热带雨林对生物多样性有较高的要求，因为它具有相对稳定的气候。

After modelling, we also conduct sensitivity analysis, which reveals our model's robustness to some parameters. We finally summarize our strengths and weaknesses. A brieconclusion is also presented in the paper.

建模后，我们还进行了敏感性分析，揭示了我们模型对一些参数的稳健性。最后，我们总结了模型的优势和劣势，并在论文中提出了简要的结论。

# 2.A Simulation Based Modelling of Multiple Fungal Ecosystems (2101951) 
## 基于模拟的多种真菌生态系统

This work has established a Multiple Fungal Model to analyze the breakdown of ground litter and woody fibers through fungal activity in different ecosystems, and uses this model to investigate the importance of biodiversity in different environments.

For Problem 1, we first distinguish the factors that directly impact the decomposition rate (𝐷𝑅), i.e. temperature, moisture and the biomass of the fungi from those indirect ones, e.g., environmental capability and competition factor. Then we establish an improved logistic competition model to obtain a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of decomposition rate and fungal biomass growth, each of which represents the direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem of fungal communities.

For Problem 2, we apply Lustenhouwer et al.’s data into our model to quantify the factors that defined in the model and to determine the effect of hyphal extension rate (𝐸𝑅) and moisture tolerance (𝑀𝑇) on the simulation results. When we analyze the factors’ impact on the result of the experiment, hypothesis testing method is used to determine the explicit expression of the differential equations and to obtain the values of each coefficients. To simulate the dynamics of the growth of fungi and the mass loss of organic compounds, we used numerical integrations as our ODEs are non-integrable. Our simulated 𝐷𝑅 − 𝐸𝑅 curve is in a good agreement with Figure 1C of Lustenhouwer et al’s work. We find that 𝑀𝑇 is approximately inversely proportional to 𝐸𝑅, where the slope is -0.154 and the intercept is 2.96. Applying this correlation into our model, we could conclude that when multiple fungal species were competing in one system, the one with medium extension rate are likely to outcompete the others in the long-term.

For Problem 3, we use the expression of the Multiple Fungal Ecosystem Model that are derived from Problem 2 to run simulation. After dividing the factors into fungal traits, competition factors and weather variation, qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis methods are used to analyze each factors’ impact on the ecosystem in both short- and long- term. Below are our key conclusions:

- Competition influence has a direct-negative influence on the growth of fungal biomass, but it has indirect-positive influence of total decomposition efficiency.

- In the case that the weather variation is not very violent, the Multiple Fungal Ecosystem decomposes in a slower rate but more steadily compared with the Single Fungal Ecosystem.

- The more difference in the optimal moisture level between each species of a fungal community, the higher resistances of the ecosystem to the environment variations; the greater the competition ability differ between two fungi, the more likely this combination to be persistent.

- Moderate environmental variations increase decomposition speed, but higher variations are likely to cause priority effect. Such an ecosystem is more likely to reach to priority effect in the long-term.

- The Multiple Fungal Ecosystem is more stable than the Single Fungal Ecosystem when confronting with rapid environmental fluctuations.

For Problem 4, we apply our model to five different weather patterns. As a result, the multiple-species system is more stable than the single-species system in all environments, and is more efficient than the simple-species system except for in the tropical rain forest and temperate weather.
For Problem 5, we find that the biodiversity is usually high in more fluctuating environments and plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of local ecosystems.

# 3.Tiny Fungi: The Defender of Carbon Cycle Balance (2103782)
## 微小的真菌碳循环平衡的捍卫者

Fungi, as almost the only lignin-decomposing species on Earth, play an important role in the 
global carbon cycle. In this paper, a mathematical model is established to analyze various factors affecting the decomposition rate of woody fibers by fungi, so as to deepen the understanding of the relationship between fungal communities and ecosystem functions.

真菌作为地球上几乎唯一能分解木质素的生物，对全球碳循环起着重要作用。本文建立了一个数学模型，分析了影响真菌对木质纤维分解速率的各种因素，以深化对真菌群落与生态系统功能之间关系的理解。

Firstly，we establish a Logistic Growth Model based on the interactions between different 
species of fungi. Considering the growth model and the moisture tolerance of the fungus, the 
decomposition rate model of fungi on woody fibers is constructed. Then, we use the collected 
fungal dataset and obtain the unknown parameters of the model. Next, we choose a combination 
of fungi to test the model. The relative error between the calculated decomposition rate and the actual value is as low as 5.5%. Meanwhile, the interactions between different species of fungi in a fixed patch of land are analyzed.

首先，我们基于不同真菌种类之间的相互作用建立了一个Logistic生长模型。考虑到生长模型和真菌的湿度耐受性，构建了真菌对木质纤维分解速率的模型。然后，我们利用收集到的真菌数据集获取了模型的未知参数。接下来，我们选择了一组真菌来测试模型。计算得到的分解速率与实际值之间的相对误差低至5.5%。同时，对同一块土地上不同真菌种类之间的相互作用进行了分析。

Secondly, considering the rapid environmental fluctuations, we analyze the effect of 
humidity on fungal activity in detail. We select a typical climate to study the short-term and 
long-term trends of fungal growth and decomposition rate, as well as the interaction between 
fungi. We find that the increase of environmental humidity can promote the growth of fungi with different promotion degree. Meanwhile, the relative competitive advantages of various fungi are different when atmospheric trends change. This will lead to the succession of fungal 
communities in different directions. Moreover, we also find that fungi with stronger moisture 
tolerance are more likely to occupy a dominant position in the arid environment.

其次，考虑到环境波动迅速，我们详细分析了湿度对真菌活动的影响。我们选择了一个典型的气候研究真菌生长和分解速率的短期和长期趋势，以及真菌之间的相互作用。我们发现环境湿度的增加可以促进具有不同促进程度的真菌生长。同时，当大气趋势变化时，各种真菌的相对竞争优势也不同。这将导致真菌群落在不同方向上的演替。此外，我们还发现在干旱环境中，湿度耐受性较强的真菌更有可能占据主导地位。

Thirdly, we employ K-means algorithm to cluster the collected dataset of fungi and analyze 
the advantages and disadvantages of fungal species and combinations of species in different 
environments. In terms of the difference of environmental humidity, we find that fungal 
communities with stable characteristics are more dominant in low humidity environments. When 
the changing rate of environmental humidity is different, fungi with slower hyphal extension rate and stronger moisture tolerance are more robust to the environmental changes. For the 
environment with little climate change, such as tropical rain forest, fungi with faster growth rate and weaker moisture tolerance are more dominant. What’s more, fungi with similar 
characteristics are more likely to coexist.

第三，我们采用K均值算法对真菌的收集数据集进行聚类，并分析了不同环境中真菌种类和组合的优劣势。在环境湿度差异方面，我们发现在低湿度环境中具有稳定特性的真菌群落更为主导。当环境湿度变化率不同时，具有较慢菌丝延伸速率和较强湿度耐受性的真菌更能抵御环境变化。对于气候变化较小的环境，如热带雨林，生长速率较快但湿度耐受性较弱的真菌更为主导。此外，具有相似特性的真菌更有可能共存。

Fourthly, the result of negative impact of environmental changes on a relatively single 
fungal community indicates that the more abundant species diversity, the more capable of 
adapting to the environmental changes. Thus, the decomposition rate can be maintained at a high level, which is conducive to the carbon cycle.

第四，对相对单一真菌群落的环境变化的负面影响的结果表明，物种多样性越丰富，适应环境变化的能力就越强。因此，分解速率可以保持在较高水平，有助于碳循环。

Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the unknown parameters, and it shows that the model 
has strong adaptability and is easier to popularize. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the model are also analyzed.

最后，我们分析了未知参数的敏感性，结果显示该模型具有较强的适应性，并更容易推广。此外，还对模型的优劣势进行了分析。

# 4.Fungi that Change the Earth (2110178)
## 改变地球的真菌

The decomposition of organics by fungi plays a vital role in the natural carbon cycle. We are
expected to determine the interactions among different fungi and the impact of environmental
fluctuations. In this paper, white-rot fungi, brown-rot fungi and Aspergillus niger are the main research objects for analysis. Three models are established.

真菌对有机物质的分解在自然碳循环中发挥着至关重要的作用。我们需要确定不同真菌之间的相互作用以及环境波动的影响。在本文中，白腐真菌、褐腐真菌和黑曲霉是主要的研究对象。建立了三个模型。

Model I: Multi-Fungi Decomposition Model. First, based on the enzymatic reaction kinetic
equation and Michaelis-Menten equation, we establish a single fungus decomposition model. Then,
by introducing competitiveness index, the interactions of multiple fungi are described, and a multi-fungi decomposition model is established. It is found that the combination of white-rot fungi and Aspergillus niger (WR & AN) would promote the decomposition of cellulose by Aspergillus niger; the combination of white-rot fungi and brown-rot fungi would inhibit the decomposition of lignin by white-rot fungi.

模型 I：多真菌分解模型。首先，基于酶反应动力学方程和Michaelis-Menten方程，我们建立了一个单一真菌分解模型。然后，通过引入竞争性指数，描述了多真菌的相互作用，并建立了一个多真菌分解模型。发现白腐真菌和黑曲霉（WR & AN）的组合会促进黑曲霉对纤维素的分解；而白腐真菌和褐腐真菌的组合会抑制白腐真菌对木质素的分解。

Model II: Multi-Fungi Interactions Model. We establish Logistic growth retardation model
and Lotka-Volterra population competition model to consider the impact of short-term and long-term interactions on fungal growth, respectively. In the short term (7 days), the growth of the three fungi is linear due to the sufficient resource; in the long term (500 days), the combination of white-rot fungi and Aspergillus niger, as well as the combination of brown-rot fungi and Aspergillus niger (BR & AN) can coexist, showing a promoting effect. However, the combination of white-rot fungi and brown-rot fungi has been eliminated from the population and cannot coexist.

模型 II：多真菌相互作用模型。我们建立Logistic生长延缓模型和Lotka-Volterra种群竞争模型，以考虑对真菌生长的短期和长期相互作用的影响。在短期内（7天），由于资源充足，三种真菌的生长是线性的；在长期内（500天），白腐真菌和黑曲霉的组合，以及褐腐真菌和黑曲霉的组合（BR & AN）可以共存，表现出促进效果。然而，白腐真菌和褐腐真菌的组合已经从种群中被淘汰，无法共存。

Model III: Multi-Fungi-Interactions-Environment Model. First, we establish the relationship model of the growth rate with the environment, and determine the influence of two environmental variables on the fungal decomposition rate. Then, through sensitivity analysis of rapid environmental fluctuations, the decomposition rate trends under temperature and humidity changes are obtained. It is found that when the temperature changes, the fungi and their combinations that are suitable for the corresponding temperature have advantages; in the case of relatively low humidity, the fungi with high moisture tolerance and their combinations have advantages.

模型 III：多真菌-相互作用-环境模型。首先，我们建立了生长速率与环境的关系模型，并确定了两个环境变量对真菌分解速率的影响。然后，通过对快速环境波动的敏感性分析，得到了在温度和湿度变化下的分解速率趋势。发现当温度变化时，适应相应温度的真菌及其组合具有优势；在相对低湿度的情况下，具有高湿度耐受性的真菌及其组合具有优势。

In addition, we predict the relative advantages and disadvantages in species and species combinations by calculating the decomposition rate under different temperature and humidity conditions. We find that all species are at a disadvantage in the colder season of temperate zone and arid environment; in the warm season of temperate zone and semi-arid environment, BR and combinationsof BR & AN have advantages, and WR and combinations of WR & AN have disadvantages; in tropical rain forests environments, the situation is reversed.

此外，通过计算在不同温度和湿度条件下的分解速率，我们预测了物种和物种组合的相对优势和劣势。发现在温带地区和干旱环境的寒冷季节，所有物种都处于劣势；在温带地区和半干旱环境的温暖季节，褐腐真菌及其组合具有优势，而白腐真菌及其组合处于劣势；在热带雨林环境中，情况则相反。

Finally, we describe the impact of fungal species diversity on the ecosystem and summarize the
importance of biodiversity: the increase in biodiversity can improve the environment’s resilience.

最后，我们描述了真菌物种多样性对生态系统的影响，并总结了生物多样性的重要性：生物多样性的增加可以提高环境的恢复力。

# 5.Cleaner of the Earth: Fungi (2120808)
## 地球的清洁工真菌

Fungi decompose organics into inorganics through their respiration, playing a 
crucial role in the ecosystem. In this paper, in order to discuss their decomposition 
ability, multiple species interaction, and significance of biodiversity, we establish 
three models: Fungal Decomposition Model, Fungai Propagation Model and Fungal 
Population Competition Model.

真菌通过它们的呼吸将有机物分解为无机物，在生态系统中起着至关重要的作用。为了讨论它们的分解能力、多种真菌相互作用以及生物多样性的重要性，我们建立了三个模型：真菌分解模型、真菌繁殖模型和真菌种群竞争模型。

To begin with, we collect the original experimental data in literature. After cleaning off redundant values, we finally obtain 34 fungal samples. Then we examine their credibility through conclusions of reference paper offered in requirement. Further, we sort these 34 samples into 3 categories through hierarchical clustering method in light of their moisture tolerance and hyphal extension rate. It covers Sprinter, Middle-distance runner, and Long-distance runner. Moreover, we put forward 4 potential models for fungal decomposition. Then, applying multiple linear regression analysis, we obtain Fungal Decomposition Model for multi species after comparison. Then, we establish population growth model for single species based on the differential equation. Further, we obtain the Fungal Propagation Model by introducing a relative environmental impact factor. Besides, we build Fungal Population Competition model. Likewise, we quantify the interaction between fungi and environment by the introduction of relative environmental impact factor. Based on these models, we conduct simulations and find that multiple species community’s population scale is 1.5 times that of single species and its decomposition rate will be 1.45 times on the condition of optimal environment and same initial proportions.

首先，我们收集了文献中的原始实验数据。在清理掉多余值后，我们最终得到了34个真菌样本。然后，我们通过参考文献中提供的结论来检验它们的可信度。此后，我们利用层次聚类方法将这34个样本根据它们的湿度耐受性和菌丝延伸速率分成3个类别，包括短跑型、中跑型和长跑型。此外，我们提出了4种潜在的真菌分解模型。然后，应用多元线性回归分析，通过比较得到了多种真菌的真菌分解模型。接着，我们基于微分方程建立了单一种群的人口增长模型。进一步，通过引入相对环境影响因子，我们得到了真菌繁殖模型。此外，我们建立了真菌种群竞争模型。同样，通过引入相对环境影响因子，我们量化了真菌与环境之间的相互作用。基于这些模型，我们进行了模拟，并发现多种真菌社区的人口规模是单一种群的1.5倍，其分解率在最佳环境和相同初始比例条件下将为1.45倍。

Next, we clarified the concrete form of environmental fluctuations. We assume that moisture in environment and temperature change periodically like trigonometric functions. Further, combining the models we established before, we analyze the sensitivity of fungal population scale and decomposition rate to rapid fluctuations in the environment both in short-term and long-term. We find that fungi, especially multiple species community, are susceptible to environmental fluctuations in the short term but stay stable in the long term. Likewise, we conduct simulations and find that multiple species community’s population scale will be 1.18 times that of single species and decomposition rate will be 0.93 times under environmental fluctuations.

接下来，我们明确了环境波动的具体形式。我们假设环境中的湿度和温度周期性地变化，就像三角函数一样。此外，结合我们之前建立的模型，我们分析了真菌人口规模和分解率对环境短期和长期快速波动的敏感性。我们发现真菌，特别是多种真菌社区，在短期内容易受到环境波动的影响，但在长期内保持稳定。同样，我们进行了模拟，发现在环境波动下，多种真菌社区的人口规模将为单一种群的1.18倍，分解率将为0.93倍。

Besides, we predict the performance of 4 combination of multiple species in different environment respectively, which includes arid, semi-arid, temperate, arboreal, and tropical rain forests. Moreover, we propose the best combination, the relative advantages and disadvantages of each species in these environments. We also find that fungi community which contains more species tend to survive more easily. Further, we compare the composition rate of single species and multiple species under optimal environmental conditions and fluctuations to illustrate the role and significance of biodiversity. We conclude that fungi system with rich biodiversity are more stable and propagate better under environmental fluctuations.

此外，我们分别预测了4种不同环境下多种真菌组合的性能，包括干旱、半干旱、温带、乔木和热带雨林。此外，我们提出了最佳组合，在这些环境中每种真菌的相对优势和劣势。我们还发现包含更多物种的真菌群落更容易生存。此外，我们比较了最佳环境条件下单一物种和多种物种的组成率，以说明生物多样性的作用和重要性。我们得出结论，具有丰富生物多样性的真菌系统在环境波动下更为稳定且更易繁殖。

Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the models and offer scientific-based and introductory article for college students. 

最后，我们讨论了模型的优缺点，并为大学生提供了基于科学的入门文章。

# 6.Fungal Decomposition Modeling via Stochastic Gradient Descent and Cellular Automata(2122025)
## 通过随机梯度下降和细胞自动机建立真菌分解模型

Fungus plays an important role as decomposers in the ecosystem. However, the efficiency of
fungal growth and decomposition is influenced by the environment and the interaction among
different species of fungi. Therefore, the study of factors affecting fungal activity is important.

真菌在生态系统中作为分解者发挥着重要作用。然而，真菌的生长和分解效率受到环境和不同真菌物种之间的相互作用的影响。因此，研究影响真菌活动的因素是重要的。

In this paper, we establish relation models among the factors that affect the extension rate
and decomposition rate of the fungi. Based on the relation models, we introduce the cellular
automata model to simulate the growth and decomposition of multiple species of fungi.

在本文中，我们建立了影响真菌菌丝延伸速率和分解速率的因素之间的关系模型。基于这些关系模型，我们引入了细胞自动机模型来模拟多种真菌的生长和分解。

Specifically, we first establish the extension rate model. The extension rate is modeled as
Arrhenius relation to the temperature and the humidity. Based on the extension rate model, we
establish the decomposition rate model. The decomposition rate is determined by extension rate and moisture trade-off, where the relation is nonlinear. To estimate the parameters in the nonlinear decomposition rate model, we establish an optimization model that fits the collected
decomposition rate data. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is utilized to solve
the nonlinear optimization problem. The stable convergence behavior shows the effectiveness
of the algorithm.

具体而言，我们首先建立了菌丝延伸速率模型。菌丝延伸速率被建模为与温度和湿度的阿伦尼乌斯关系。基于菌丝延伸速率模型，我们建立了分解速率模型。分解速率由菌丝延伸速率和湿度权衡决定，其关系是非线性的。为了估计非线性分解速率模型中的参数，我们建立了一个拟合收集到的分解速率数据的优化模型。我们利用随机梯度下降（SGD）算法来解决非线性优化问题。稳定的收敛行为显示了该算法的有效性。

Based on the decomposition rate model, we establish the cellular automata model to simulate the growth and decomposition of the fungi. The extension rate and decomposition rate are
utilized to determine the rules of cellular automata. The simulation results show that under the same environment, the number of different species of fungi increased significantly at the first 5−10 days. Then, after about 10 days of extension, the number of fungi decreases to a certain extent and then stabilized after about 40 days. The decomposition rate after 122 days is 0.68.

基于分解速率模型，我们建立了细胞自动机模型来模拟真菌的生长和分解。菌丝延伸速率和分解速率被用来确定细胞自动机的规则。模拟结果显示，在相同的环境下，不同种类的真菌数量在最初的5-10天内显著增加。然后，在约10天的延伸后，真菌数量在一定程度上减少，并在大约40天后稳定。122天后的分解速率为0.68。

Next, we describe the interactions among different species of fungi by competitive relationship. To describe the competitive relationship, we propose a definition to measure the reduction of the extension rate. Based on this definition, we establish the cellular automata model under fungal interactions to simulate the fungal activity under interactions. The results show that after considering the interaction, the number of different types of fungi is considerably decreased by an average percentage of 33.65%. And the decomposition rate after 122 days is 0.39, which is 42.69% lower than that of the situation without competition.

接下来，我们通过竞争关系描述不同种类真菌之间的相互作用。为了描述竞争关系，我们提出了一个用于衡量菌丝延伸速率减少的定义。基于这个定义，我们建立了考虑真菌相互作用的细胞自动机模型来模拟相互作用下的真菌活动。结果显示，在考虑相互作用后，不同类型真菌的数量平均减少了33.65%。122天后的分解速率为0.39，比没有竞争的情况下低了42.69%。

Afterward, we analyze the influence of fungal interactions. In the short term, the interaction
between different types of fungi is not obvious. In the long-term, the influence is significant
due to the shortage of nutrients. Afterward, the sensitivity of our models is studied. We show
that our models are sensitive to 8% change of temperature and humidity. Then, the analysis
of combinations of fungi and different environments are included. The dominant and disadvantaged species in different situations are obtained, e.g., Trichoderma becomes the dominant species in the tropical rain forest after 122 days with the decomposition rate of 68.29%. At last, we analyze the importance of biodiversity. The results show that biodiversity is important to the efficiency of fungal decomposition, where the decomposition rate of fungi under multi-species is 2.89 times higher than that of single species.

随后，我们分析了真菌相互作用的影响。在短期内，不同类型真菌之间的相互作用并不明显。在长期内，由于养分短缺，影响显著。然后，我们研究了我们模型的敏感性。我们展示了我们的模型对温度和湿度变化的8%的敏感性。然后，包括真菌组合和不同环境的分析。在不同情况下获得了优势和劣势的真菌物种，例如，在122天后，三刃菌在热带雨林中成为主导物种，分解速率为68.29%。最后，我们分析了生物多样性的重要性。结果显示，生物多样性对真菌分解的效率至关重要，多物种真菌的分解速率比单一物种高2.89倍。
