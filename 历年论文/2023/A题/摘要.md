# 1. Community Succession Simulation: Surviving Drought（2300336）
## 植物群落演替模拟：抵御干旱

The species richness of plant communities has a significant influence on their ability to withstand drought. From an ecological niche perspective, we simulate plant community succession under drought conditions and analyze the effects of various factors.

植物群落的物种丰富度对其抵御干旱的能力有显著影响。从生态位的角度出发，我们模拟了干旱条件下植物群落的演替，并分析了各种因素的影响。

First, we develop the Plant Community Succession Model based on niche theory to simulate community succession under drought conditions. The model applies changes in niche width as the indicator to simulate community succession and utilizes competition matrix to describe interactions between species, including competition and facilitation. Then, the Niche Width Model is established, comprehensively considering the effects of reproduction, mortality, and uncertainties. Among them, reproduction depends on the degree of drought, niche width, interspecific
relationships, and environmental capacity, while mortality depends on the degree of drought and the niche width. Uncertainties are measured with Gaussian white noise. 

首先，我们基于生态位理论开发了植物群落演替模型，以模拟干旱条件下的群落演替。该模型以生态位宽度的变化作为指标来模拟群落演替，利用竞争矩阵描述了物种之间的相互作用，包括竞争和促进。然后，建立了生态位宽度模型，全面考虑了繁殖、死亡和不确定性的影响。其中，繁殖取决于干旱程度、生态位宽度、种间关系和环境容量，而死亡取决于干旱程度和生态位宽度。不确定性通过高斯白噪声进行测量。

A niche width differential equation model is built based on the Beverton-Holt and the Lotka-Volterra equations. To account for various irregular weather cycles, we utilize random variables obeying normal distribution to simulate the extent and duration of drought. As a case study, we simulate the evolution of a three-species community and draw the conclusion that the total niche width of the community increases, suggesting long-term survival.

基于 Beverton-Holt 和 Lotka-Volterra 方程，建立了生态位宽度微分方程模型。为了考虑各种不规则的气候周期，我们利用服从正态分布的随机变量来模拟干旱的程度和持续时间。作为案例研究，我们模拟了一个三物种群落的演化，并得出结论：群落的总生态位宽度增加，表明具有长期存活能力。

To investigate the influence of species number on community dynamics, we utilize the Plant Community Evolution Model to simulate communities containing one to four species separately. The results demonstrate that three species are necessary for the community to benefit. Additionally,
as the number of species increases, the drought resistance improves and then stabilizes.

为了研究物种数量对群落动态的影响，我们利用植物群落演替模型分别模拟包含一到四个物种的群落。结果表明，三个物种对群落的益处至关重要。此外，随着物种数量的增加，抗旱能力提高并趋于稳定。

Based on the competition matrix, we set up three distinct communities and discuss their drought resistance through simulations. It can be concluded that facilitation-dominated relationships enhance drought resistance and increase the community’s survival time. Moreover, we vary the frequency and intensity of drought and then conclude that species extinction is more likely to occur during severe droughts. 

基于竞争矩阵，我们建立了三个不同的群落，并通过模拟讨论了它们的抗旱能力。可以得出结论：以促进为主导的关系增强了抗旱能力并延长了群落的存活时间。此外，我们变化了干旱的频率和强度，然后得出结论：在严重干旱期间，物种灭绝更有可能发生。

Pollution and habitat shrinkage affect plant communities’ niche width and competitive relationships.Therefore, we adjust the niche width and competition matrix accordingly. The results indicate that pollution and habitat shrinkage may cause the extinction of certain species.

污染和栖息地缩小影响植物群落的生态位宽度和竞争关系。因此，我们相应调整了生态位宽度和竞争矩阵。结果表明，污染和栖息地缩小可能导致某些物种的灭绝。

Finally, based on the impact of various factors, we recommend some measures to ensure the long-term viability of a plant community. Additionally, we also analyze the significance of protecting vulnerable communities for the overall health of ecosystems.

最后，基于各种因素的影响，我们推荐一些措施来确保植物群落的长期生存。此外，我们还分析了保护脆弱群落对生态系统整体健康的重要性。

# 2. The Comprehensive Prediction Model for Drought-Striken Plant Communities（2300661）
## 干旱植物群落综合预测模型

Global warming is becoming more and more serious, which has also led to increased drought in some areas. It seriously affects the long-term viability of local plant communities. In order to understand the changing patterns of plant communities in arid regions, we propose three models, a
Logistic model that takes into account drought and intermediate interactions, a new model that measures changes in biomass and benefits, and a modified model that takes into account pollution
and habitat reduction.

全球变暖问题日益严重，这也导致了一些地区干旱的加剧。这严重影响了当地植物群落的长期生存能力。为了了解干旱地区植物群落的变化模式，我们提出了三个模型，一个考虑了干旱和种间相互作用的 Logistic 模型，一个测量生物量和效益变化的新模型，以及一个考虑污染和栖息地减少的修改模型。

First, we establish a Logistic model considering drought and interspecific interactions to predict the population changes of four plant species in the Tengger Desert, Northwest China. Through the comparison of plant quantity changes under regular and irregular drought cycles, it is found that different plants have different adaptability to drought environment because of their own characteristics. At the same time, we find that heavy rainfall followed by rapid drought processes can seriously threaten plant survival.

首先，我们建立了一个考虑干旱和种间相互作用的 Logistic 模型，以预测中国西北部腾格里沙漠中四种植物物种的种群变化。通过比较常规和不规则干旱周期下植物数量变化，发现不同植物因其自身特性对干旱环境有不同的适应性。同时，我们发现暴雨后紧随而来的迅速干旱过程可能严重威胁植物的生存。

Second, we use biomass to construct a new model to measure the benefit degree of plant communities, and randomly select 2, 3 and 4 species from the four plant species for analysis. On the one hand, we find that as the number of species increases, more and more selected combinations show
positive benefits, and the benefits are gradually increasing.On the other hand, we divide the plants into sensitive types and drought-tolerant types, and find that the biomass of sensitive types is more susceptible to fluctuation of drought intensity, while the biomass of drought-tolerant types remain stable under drought, but decrease due to increased competition under sufficient rainfall.

其次，我们使用生物量构建一个新模型来衡量植物群落的效益程度，并从四种植物物种中随机选择 2、3 和 4 种进行分析。一方面，我们发现随着物种数量的增加，越来越多的选择组合显示出积极的效益，并且效益逐渐增加。另一方面，我们将植物分为敏感型和耐旱型，发现敏感型的生物量更容易受到干旱强度波动的影响，而耐旱型在干旱条件下保持稳定，但在充足降雨的情况下由于竞争增加而减少。

Third, we use the Monte Carlo method to generate two new precipitation distributions with greater and lesser drought frequency and severity, and analyzed four plant species using the previous model. We find that plant biomass remain stable in both conditions, but not in the same amount.

第三，我们使用蒙特卡洛方法生成两个新的降水分布，其干旱频率和强度分别更大和更小，并使用先前的模型分析四种植物物种。我们发现在这两种条件下，植物生物量都保持稳定，但数量不同。

Fourth, we modify the previous model by introducing pollution degree and habitat reduction index, and analyze the changes in the number of four plants again in combination with the actual situation of factory construction. We find that habitat loss has a bigger side effect than pollution, and the combination of the two keeps plant populations lower over time.

第四，我们通过引入污染程度和栖息地减少指数修改先前的模型，并结合工厂建设的实际情况再次分析四种植物的数量变化。我们发现栖息地的丧失比污染的影响更大，两者的结合使植物种群随时间保持较低水平。

Fifth, we conduct sensitivity analysis of some initial parameters of the four plants to explore how these parameters affect the model and simulation experiment.We find that the maximum number of individual plants under ideal conditions has a relatively large effect on the experiment, but it is within the acceptable range. This reflects the robustness of our model.

第五，我们对四种植物的一些初始参数进行敏感性分析，以探讨这些参数对模型和模拟实验的影响。我们发现在理想条件下个体植物的最大数量对实验有相对较大的影响，但在可接受范围内。这反映了我们模型的鲁棒性。

At last, we optimize the solving method of the model. We use the fourth order Runge-Kutta method to solve the model and get more accurate prediction results. We also use the analysis results to make valuable suggestions on how to improve the viability of plant communities under drought conditions and contribute to environmental governance.

最后，我们优化了模型的求解方法。我们使用四阶龙格-库塔方法解决模型，并获得更准确的预测结果。我们还利用分析结果提出了有关如何提高干旱条件下植物群落生存能力并促进环境治理的宝贵建议。

# 3. A Methodology to Simulate Drought-Stricken Plant Communities（2303950）
## 模拟干旱植物群落的方法学

The study of plant communities in arid areas is an indispensable part of environmental protection. In these regions, annual plants are important components of vegetation, by virtue of their unique characteristics. This paper presents a method of simulation for the growth, competition, and facilitation of annual plants, which can be applied to various circumstances.

对于干旱地区植物群落的研究是环境保护的不可或缺的一部分。在这些地区，由于其独特的特性，年生植物是植被的重要组成部分。本文提出了一种模拟年生植物生长、竞争和促进的方法，可应用于各种情境。

To begin with, we establish the Growth Model of annual plants. At first, we determine the relationship between soil water content and the natural growth rate in Logistic Model. Then, we build the differential equation of soil water content, based on the stochastic rainfall model. 

首先，我们建立了年生植物的生长模型。首先，在 Logistic 模型中确定了土壤含水量与自然生长速率之间的关系。然后，基于随机降雨模型，建立了土壤含水量的微分方程。

Finally, we establish the law of annual plant reproduction. To estimate the statistical parameters in the stochastic rainfall model, we use Normal Equation to get the optimal parameters according to Least Square Method.

最后，我们建立了年生植物繁殖规律。为了估计随机降雨模型中的统计参数，我们使用正规方程根据最小二乘法得到最优参数。

Based on the Growth Model, we establish the Competition Model of various plants to simulate their root competition. For the competition coefficient in Lotka-Volterra Model, we innovatively determine its relationship with root growth and water-utilizing capacity of plants. Considering the structure of root system, we estimate the parameters in the model reasonably.

基于生长模型，我们建立了各种植物的竞争模型，以模拟它们的根系竞争。对于 Lotka-Volterra 模型中的竞争系数，我们创新性地确定其与根系生长和植物利用水能力的关系。考虑到根系结构，我们合理估计了模型中的参数。

Based on the Competition Model, we further establish the Facilitation Model of shrub plants to herbaceous plants. Given the water-lifting action of shrub plants, we modify the water absorption rate in the Competition Model. So far, our models have been elaborated and the parameters have been estimated properly.

基于竞争模型，我们进一步建立了灌木植物对草本植物的促进模型。考虑到灌木植物的提水作用，我们修改了竞争模型中的吸水速率。到目前为止，我们的模型已经详细阐述，并且参数已经得到了适当的估计。

After that, we use the fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm to give numerical solutions to the differential equations. And the problems in the Requirement have been solved as follows:

之后，我们使用四阶 Runge-Kutta 算法对微分方程进行数值求解。并且根据需求中的问题得到了以下解决方案：

Based on the results from our TOPSIS model, at least eight plant species are required to provide overall benefits for the community. As the number of plant species grows, the scale of the community will decrease, while the community will embrace better stability.

基于我们 TOPSIS 模型的结果，至少需要八种植物物种为群落提供整体效益。随着植物物种数量的增加，群落的规模将减小，而群落将拥抱更好的稳定性。

By improving the water absorption efficiency of herbaceous plants, shrubs can reduce the interspecific competition, make the average biomass of different herbaceous plants close to each other, and improve the stability of biodiversity.

通过提高草本植物的吸水效率，灌木可以减少种间竞争，使不同草本植物的平均生物量趋于一致，并提高生物多样性的稳定性。

Under more severe drought conditions provided in Section 5.4, the scale of the community will be decreased by over 67% and the fluctuation of the evolution will be enlarged by over 36%. But these indexes still follow the similar trend in Section 5.2 as the number of species grows regardless of different weather cycles.

在第 5.4 节提供的更严重的干旱条件下，群落的规模将减小超过 67%，演替的波动将增大超过 36%。但这些指标仍然遵循在第 5.2 节中物种数量增加的趋势，而不考虑不同的气候周期。

The effects of two typical types of pollutants are compared. The results show that pollutants such as acid rain are more dangerous because it can decrease the scale by 14.6% and increase the fluctuation by 14.4% at the same time. Also, the diminishment of habitat by 50% will cause the system to lose 22.9% of its scale but reduce 8.7% of its fluctuation.

比较了两种典型污染物的效果。结果显示，酸雨等污染物更危险，因为它可以同时减小规模 14.6% 并增加波动 14.4%。此外，栖息地减少 50% 将导致系统失去 22.9% 的规模，但减少 8.7% 的波动。

Based on our model and analysis, our strategies are expressed from two main aspects：the Preservation and Modification of the ecosystem.

基于我们的模型和分析，我们的策略从两个主要方面表达：生态系统的保护和修改。

Finally, the sensitivity and stability of the model are fully analyzed.

最后，对模型的敏感性和稳定性进行了全面分析。

# 4. The Warriors against Drought: Plant Communities（2309229）
## 抗击干旱的勇士：植物群落

As the severe drought increases since the global warming, many plant communities die out for lack of water, while others can recover after drought. To explore this phenomenon, we develop GIID model to describe the response of communities to drought and analyse whether species diversity can help communities withstand drought.

随着全球变暖导致的严重干旱加剧，许多植物群落因水源匮乏而死亡，而其他一些则可以在干旱后复苏。为了探索这一现象，我们开发了GIID模型来描述群落对干旱的响应，并分析物种多样性是否有助于群落抵御干旱。

Before all the models are established, we select five typical plant species and classifiy them into three categories, according to their inherent growth rate and optimum soil moisture. In addition, we estimate the parameters used in our models.

在建立所有模型之前，我们选择了五种典型的植物物种，并根据它们固有的生长速率和最适土壤湿度将它们分类为三类。此外，我们估计了我们模型中使用的参数。

For Task 1: To simulate plant growth and interspecific competition, we first developed the Lotka-Volterra competition model. Then, considering optimum soil moisture of each species, we set the environmental capacity of them as a function of soil moisture. Finally, we modeled the soil moisture variation to describe the interaction between plants and the environment. We consider the water absorption by plants, irregular rainfall, and other factors. We summarize these analysis and devise our GIID model. Then, we verify the correctness ofmodel. The results are shown in Figure 7.

对于任务1：为了模拟植物的生长和种间竞争，我们首先开发了Lotka-Volterra竞争模型。然后，考虑到每个物种的最适土壤湿度，我们将它们的环境容量设定为土壤湿度的函数。最后，我们建立了描述植物与环境之间相互作用的土壤湿度变化模型。我们考虑了植物的吸水、不规则降雨等因素。我们总结了这些分析结果并设计了我们的GIID模型。然后，我们验证了模型的正确性。结果显示在图7中。

For Task 2: First, we do the qualitative analysis and find that the Five Species Community is more stable in drought. To quantify how the community benefits from the species diversity, we calculate total biomass, coefficient of variation of total biomass, and S-W index to evaluate the vigor, stability, and evenness of the ecosystem respectively. The experimental results show that as the number of species increases, the total biomass of the community increases and then decreases, while the stability and evenness keep increasing. Besides, two species are required for the community to benefit. The results are shown in Figure 10 to 13.

对于任务2：首先，我们进行了定性分析，发现五物种群落在干旱中更加稳定。为了定量评估群落如何从物种多样性中受益，我们分别计算了总生物量、总生物量的变异系数和S-W指数，用于评估生态系统的活力、稳定性和均匀性。实验结果表明，随着物种数量的增加，群落的总生物量先增加后减少，而稳定性和均匀性不断增加。此外，群落受益所需的物种数量为两种。结果显示在图10至13中。

For Task 3: To explore the effect of species type, we choose three typical species combinations and each combination is simulated separately. We find that combinations with moderate differences in optimum soil moisture increase the total biomass and stability of the community. And if the differences in optimum soil moisture of species are too small or too
large, the community would not benefit.

对于任务3：为了探索物种类型的影响，我们选择了三种典型的物种组合，并分别对每种组合进行了模拟。我们发现在最适土壤湿度差异适中的组合中，群落的总生物量和稳定性增加。如果物种的最适土壤湿度差异太小或太大，群落就无法受益。

For task 4: We adjust the magnitude and frequency of droughts, and the experiment results show that: when droughts become stronger and more frequent, the complementary effect among species also becomes stronger. And the biomass of the community increases as the number of species increases. When droughts are less frequent, the competition among species is stronger, and the increase in the number of species lead to decrease in total biomass. The increase in the number of species always enhances community stability.

对于任务4：我们调整了干旱的幅度和频率，实验结果显示：当干旱变得更强烈和更频繁时，物种之间的互补效应也变得更强。随着物种数量的增加，群落的生物量增加。当干旱不太频繁时，物种之间的竞争更加激烈，物种数量的增加导致总生物量减少。物种数量的增加总是增强群落的稳定性。

For Tasks 5 and 6: We attributed the effects of habitat loss and environmental pollution to the decrease in environmental capacity. So we set up a step function to simulate this process. We find that habitat loss and environmental pollution will lead to decrease in total community biomass, while multi species community will still have high stability in this process. Next, we illustrate the measures to ensure the long-term viability of the community. We also describe the impact of the community on the environment based on above findings.

对于任务5和6：我们将栖息地损失和环境污染的影响归因于环境容量的减少。因此，我们建立了一个阶梯函数来模拟这个过程。我们发现栖息地损失和环境污染会导致总群落生物量减少，而多物种群落在这一过程中仍然具有较高的稳定性。接下来，我们阐述了确保群落长期生存的措施。我们还根据以上发现描述了群落对环境的影响。

Finally, we change the plant competition intensity, water absorption rate and climate patterns in order to perform sensitivity analysis on these parameters. We find that our model is sensitive to all of them. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the model and discuss how to improve it.

最后，我们改变了植物之间的竞争强度、吸水速率和气候模式，以对这些参数进行敏感性分析。我们发现我们的模型对所有这些参数都很敏感。我们还分析了模型的优势和不足，并讨论了如何改进它。

# 5. Dry or Die? Drought-Stricken Plant Communities Can Survive!（2316994）
## 干旱或死亡？干旱植物群落可以存活！

Under climate change, there will probably be an increase in inter-annual variability in precipitation regimes and more intense and frequent extreme weather and climate events, including multi-year droughts. Therefore, it’s necessary to focus on the drought adaptability of plant community. Our team build the following mathematical model to explore the responsive mechanism of plant community to drought in this paper.

在气候变化下，降水制度的年际变异可能会增加，极端天气和气候事件（包括多年干旱）也可能变得更加强烈和频繁。因此，有必要关注植物群落的干旱适应能力。本文团队建立了以下数学模型，探讨植物群落对干旱的响应机制。

Firstly, to consider the influence of plants’ interspecific interactions, we have improved on the classical model Lotka-Volterra Model by adjusting the equation between two species to multispecies differential equations based on Logistic Equation. We use Spearman Correlation Analysisto get the coefficients to measure the interaction between different species. When the distribution of two species is positively correlated, we believe that the two species are mutually beneficial to a certain extent.

首先，为考虑植物种间相互作用的影响，我们在经典的Lotka-Volterra模型上进行了改进，通过根据Logistic方程调整两物种之间的方程，得到基于Logistic方程的多物种微分方程。我们使用Spearman相关分析来获得系数，以衡量不同物种之间的相互作用。当两个物种的分布呈正相关时，我们认为这两个物种在一定程度上是相互有益的。

Then, we consider the impact of environmental factors. Collecting the weather data for the past 15 years, we fit the linear relationship between precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture. We also define a environmental impact factor Q, adding it to the basic differential equations. Then We use the computer to set up temperature and precipitation and control changing period to simulate irregular weather cycles. The stochastic simulation is based on real data and can be adjusted artificially. By this model we predict the change trend of plant communities over time.

然后，我们考虑环境因素的影响。收集过去15年的天气数据，拟合降水、温度和土壤湿度之间的线性关系。我们还定义了一个环境影响因子Q，并将其添加到基本微分方程中。然后，我们使用计算机设置温度和降水，并控制变化周期，模拟不规则的气候周期。这种基于真实数据的随机模拟可以人工调整。通过这个模型，我们预测植物群落随时间的变化趋势。

Next, by measuring the Shannno-Wiener index and ICV (the reciprocal of variation coefficient of species’ biomass), we get specific quantitative indicators for the drought adaptability of plant community. We calculate the change rates of the two indexes of plant communities after a period of time under different situations. Measuring each community with different species from 2 to 7, We find that the minimal number of plant species is 5 if the community want to benefit from this biodiversity. The more species, the better drought adaptability of community.

接下来，通过测量Shannno-Wiener指数和ICV（物种生物量变异系数的倒数），我们得到了植物群落的干旱适应能力的具体定量指标。我们计算了不同情况下植物群落在一段时间后两个指标的变化率。通过对具有不同物种的每个群落进行测量，从2到7种物种，我们发现如果群落想要从生物多样性中受益，最小植物物种数量为5。物种越多，群落的干旱适应能力就越好。

Furthermore, we further analyze potential impact of more complex environment to make our model more complete and comprehensive. We take the habitat reduction, environmental pollution, and climate warming into consideration. For each factor, we draw the biomass of species changing curve over time to intuitively show the influence of this factor.

此外，我们进一步分析了更复杂环境的潜在影响，使我们的模型更加完整和全面。我们考虑了栖息地减少、环境污染和气候变暖。对于每个因素，我们绘制了物种生物量随时间变化的曲线，直观显示了该因素的影响。

Finally, we use Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) Model to assess the importance of each factor. We obtain four weight indicators as 0.257, 0.543, 0.131, and 0.069 for the number of species, the types of species, the weather cycles, and other environmental factors. These indicators help us to better analyze the ways to ensure the long-term viability of a plant community. The larger the indicators, the more it takes precedence over other factors that we need to pay more attention to it.

最后，我们使用层次分析过程（AHP）模型评估每个因素的重要性。我们得到的四个权重指标分别为0.257、0.543、0.131和0.069，对应于物种数量、物种类型、气候周期和其他环境因素。这些指标帮助我们更好地分析确保植物群落长期生存的方法。指标越大，它就优先于其他因素，我们需要更多关注它。

# 6. Drought Tolerance of a Plant Community under Multi-species Interaction（2321860）
## 多物种相互作用下植物群落的抗旱能力

Drought conditions have a significant effect on plant growth, and different species respond differently to drought. Population interactions in communities can affect the evolution of communities under drought conditions. To study the response of plant communities to drought under multi-species interactions, we used population density, biomass, net primary production (NPP) and soil water content as four evaluation indicators, and integrated the effects of precipitation, evaporation, inter-species interactions, pollution and habitat reduction on plant communities.

干旱条件对植物生长有显著影响，不同物种对干旱的响应也各不相同。社区中的种群相互作用可以影响植物群落在干旱条件下的演变。为了研究植物群落在多物种相互作用下对干旱的响应，我们以种群密度、生物量、净初级生产力（NPP）和土壤含水量为四个评估指标，并综合考虑了降水、蒸发、物种间相互作用、污染和栖息地减少对植物群落的影响。

Based on the traditional Logistic model, we modified the growth rate term, the maximum environmental holding capacity and the water use efficiency in it, and added an interspecific interaction term. Specifically, a Soil water content model was constructed, and applied to the above three terms (taking into account the drought stress threshold response); an Interspecies interaction model was constructed by analyzing the competition between two plants and applied to multiple populations in the community; the interspecific interaction term was added to the population density model and corrected. After establishing the Population density model, we used the Michaelis-Menten equation to construct the Biomass model from population density and then calculate the net primary productivity (NPP) per unit area of the community. Our fitting results were close to the real values, demonstrating the plausibility of our model.

基于传统的Logistic模型，我们修改了其中的生长速率项、最大环境持有能力和水分利用效率，并增加了种间相互作用项。具体而言，构建了土壤含水量模型，并应用于上述三个项（考虑了干旱应激阈值响应）；通过分析两植物间的竞争，构建了物种间相互作用模型，并应用于社区中的多个种群；将物种间相互作用项添加到种群密度模型中并进行了修正。在建立了种群密度模型后，我们使用Michaelis-Menten方程从种群密度构建了生物量模型，然后计算了社区单位面积的净初级生产力（NPP）。我们的拟合结果接近实际值，证明了我们模型的可行性。

To explore the effects of various irregular weather cycles on plant communities, we simulated three different precipitation patterns, and used our model to predict four indicators mentioned above. It was found that a moderate, steady humidity is conducive to the growth of plants, and high drought tolerant plants adapt better in dry environment.

为了探究各种不规则气象周期对植物群落的影响，我们模拟了三种不同的降水模式，并使用我们的模型预测了上述四个指标。发现适度、稳定的湿度有利于植物生长，高抗旱植物在干燥环境中更适应。

To explore the long-term effects of species richness and different species varieties on communities, we chose species from different group combinations (categorized by drought tolerance), and calculated the average total NPP under each species number. We found that when there are at least four species, the plant community shows higher resistence to irregular weather cycles, but the impact was smaller under greater level of drought. Moreover, plants that are less resistent to drought contribute more NPP in a community.

为了探究物种丰富度和不同物种品种对群落的长期影响，我们选择了不同组合的物种（按抗旱性分类），并计算了每个物种数量下平均总NPP。我们发现当至少有四种物种时，植物群落对不规则气象周期表现出较高的抵抗力，但在更大程度的干旱下影响较小。此外，对抗旱能力较差的植物在社区中贡献了更多的NPP。

To explore the effects of pollution and habitat reduction on plant communities, we added new factors to the population density model, modified the model to predict changes in total NPP of the plant community under natural precipitation in the area.

为了探究污染和栖息地减少对植物群落的影响，我们在种群密度模型中添加了新的因素，并修改了该模型以预测该地区在自然降水情况下植物群落总NPP的变化。

Finally, based on these conclusions, we offered suggestions for the conservation of the plant communities and discussed the impact of these measures on wider environment.

最后，基于这些结论，我们提出了保护植物群落的建议，并讨论了这些措施对更广泛环境的影响。

# 7. Is There Space for More? A Spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations Model for Plant Growth During Drought Cycles（2322687）
## 还有更多的空间吗？植物在干旱周期中生长的时空偏微分方程模型

Droughts pose a significant risk to the survival of a community of plants. Although individual plants may struggle to adapt to a lack of water caused by a drought, existing literature has suggested a positive relationship between the biodiversity of a plant community and its ability to survive drought cycles. We have been tasked to verify this claim and build a generalized biome-independent model that predicts changes in a plant community through cycles of drought.

干旱对植物群落的生存构成重大风险。尽管个体植物可能难以适应由于干旱引起的水分缺乏，但现有文献表明植物群落的生物多样性与其在干旱周期中生存的能力之间存在积极关系。我们的任务是验证这一说法并建立一个通用的、独立于生态系统的模型，预测植物群落在干旱周期中的变化。

Our approach was to develop a parameterized partial differential equations model for the growth of multiple plant species over time on the basis of the amount of water available. Crucially, we also incorporate spatial dimensions and analysisinto the model, which allows us to consider plant dispersal and water diffusion across physical boundaries. To support this growth model, we also implement a sub-model for rainfall that can simulate the effect of a variety of droughts by changing drought timing and severity. Incorporating this into the plant growth model, we model plant growth in Mathematica using numerical analysis of the partial differential equations. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the model’s parameters, simulating the effects of biodiversity by steadily increasing the number of unique species starting from a control of just one species. We also analyze the impact of different types of droughts, as well as different types of plants as measured by their resistance and resilience. We conclude by studying the impacts of external factors, such as pollution or habitat reduction.

我们的方法是基于水分可用量，开发了一个多植物种类随时间生长的参数化偏微分方程模型。关键的是，我们还将空间维度和分析纳入模型，这使我们能够考虑植物的传播和水分在物理边界上的扩散。为了支持这个生长模型，我们还实现了一个降雨的子模型，可以通过改变干旱的时机和严重程度来模拟各种干旱的影响。将这纳入植物生长模型，我们使用数值分析对偏微分方程进行Mathematica模拟。我们对模型的参数进行了敏感性分析，通过逐渐增加独特物种的数量（从仅有一个物种的控制开始），模拟了生物多样性的影响。我们还分析了不同类型的干旱以及通过其抗性和弹性测量的不同类型的植物的影响。最后，我们研究了外部因素的影响，如污染或栖息地减少。

Ultimately, we find that although increasing the number of unique plants in a given community generates inter-species competition, it cumulatively benefits the overall system by increasing the total amount of long-term plant biomass. However, marginal benefit decreases as total number of unique species increases: going from one to two unique species generates significant benefits in total biomass, but changes are smaller when going from two to three, and the transition from three to four actually decreases total biomass. Meanwhile, our sensitivity analysis finds that changes in resilience and resistance correspondingly impact total plant biomass but do not affect the general behavior of the model. In addition, we determine that habitat destruction can cause individual species to dominate a plant community due to increased spatial competition. We find under certain extreme conditions, a given species of plants can either survive and dominate in the long-term or go extinct depending on their initial conditions.

最终，我们发现，虽然在给定的社区中增加独特植物的数量会产生物种间的竞争，但它通过增加总的长期植物生物量来累积地使整个系统受益。然而，随着独特物种总数的增加，边际效益减小：从一个到两个独特物种产生了总生物量的显著效益，但从两个到三个的变化较小，而从三个到四个的转变实际上减少了总生物量。与此同时，我们的敏感性分析发现，抗性和弹性的变化相应地影响总植物生物量，但不影响模型的一般行为。此外，我们确定栖息地破坏会导致个体物种在植物群落中占主导地位，因为空间竞争增加。在某些极端条件下，给定物种的植物根据其初始条件可能在长期内存活并占主导地位，也可能灭绝。

The main advantage of our unique spatial approach over traditional, space-independent models that only depend upon time, like the classic Lotka-Volterra model, is the the ability to account for fundamental physical behaviors of plants and ground water—that is, dispersal and diffusion across a 2D space. Without spatial considerations, one cannot accurately model the fact that generally, plants and water can only spread to adjacent locations. This also allows us to model phenomenon like competition for habitation or water at a given location. Finally, the spatial approach also provides the ability to simulate random initial locations, mirroring the stochasticity of real-world environments, as well as forecast the impacts of habitat reduction easily. Combined with a realistic model for rainfall data and drought conditions, our model serves as a comprehensive general phenomenological model for simulating plant growth in any given community under cycles of droughts.

我们独特的空间方法相对于传统的、仅依赖于时间的独立于空间的模型，如经典的Lotka-Volterra模型，其主要优势在于能够考虑植物和地下水的基本物理行为——即在二维空间中的传播和扩散。没有空间考虑，无法准确地模拟植物和水通常只能传播到相邻位置的事实。这还使我们能够模拟在给定位置对栖息地或水的竞争等现象。最后，空间方法还提供了模拟随机初始位置的能力，反映了真实环境的随机性，以及轻松预测栖息地减少的影响。结合具有现实降雨数据和干旱条件的模型，我们的模型作为一个全面的、通用的现象学模型，用于模拟在干旱周期下任何给定社区中植物生长。
