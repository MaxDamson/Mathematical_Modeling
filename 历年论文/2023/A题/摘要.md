# 1. Community Succession Simulation: Surviving Drought（2300336）
## 

The species richness of plant communities has a significant influence on their ability to withstand drought. From an ecological niche perspective, we simulate plant community succession under drought conditions and analyze the effects of various factors.

First, we develop the Plant Community Succession Model based on niche theory to simulate community succession under drought conditions. The model applies changes in niche width as the indicator to simulate community succession and utilizes competition matrix to describe interactions between species, including competition and facilitation. Then, the Niche Width Model is established, comprehensively considering the effects of reproduction, mortality, and uncertainties. Among them, reproduction depends on the degree of drought, niche width, interspecific
relationships, and environmental capacity, while mortality depends on the degree of drought and the niche width. Uncertainties are measured with Gaussian white noise. 

A niche width differential equation model is built based on the Beverton-Holt and the Lotka-Volterra equations. To account for various irregular weather cycles, we utilize random variables obeying normal distribution to simulate the extent and duration of drought. As a case study, we simulate the evolution of a three-species community and draw the conclusion that the total niche width of the community increases, suggesting long-term survival.

To investigate the influence of species number on community dynamics, we utilize the Plant Community Evolution Model to simulate communities containing one to four species separately. The results demonstrate that three species are necessary for the community to benefit. Additionally,
as the number of species increases, the drought resistance improves and then stabilizes.

Based on the competition matrix, we set up three distinct communities and discuss their drought resistance through simulations. It can be concluded that facilitation-dominated relationships enhance drought resistance and increase the community’s survival time. Moreover, we vary the frequency and intensity of drought and then conclude that species extinction is more likely to occur during severe droughts. 

Pollution and habitat shrinkage affect plant communities’ niche width and competitive relationships.Therefore, we adjust the niche width and competition matrix accordingly. The results indicate that pollution and habitat shrinkage may cause the extinction of certain species.

Finally, based on the impact of various factors, we recommend some measures to ensure the long-term viability of a plant community. Additionally, we also analyze the significance of protecting vulnerable communities for the overall health of ecosystems.

# 2. The Comprehensive Prediction Model for Drought-Striken Plant Communities（2300661）
## 

Global warming is becoming more and more serious, which has also led to increased drought in some areas. It seriously affects the long-term viability of local plant communities. In order to understand the changing patterns of plant communities in arid regions, we propose three models, a
Logistic model that takes into account drought and intermediate interactions, a new model that measures changes in biomass and benefits, and a modified model that takes into account pollution
and habitat reduction.

First, we establish a Logistic model considering drought and interspecific interactions to predict the population changes of four plant species in the Tengger Desert, Northwest China. Through the comparison of plant quantity changes under regular and irregular drought cycles, it is found that different plants have different adaptability to drought environment because of their own characteristics. At the same time, we find that heavy rainfall followed by rapid drought processes can seriously threaten plant survival.

Second, we use biomass to construct a new model to measure the benefit degree of plant communities, and randomly select 2, 3 and 4 species from the four plant species for analysis. On the one hand, we find that as the number of species increases, more and more selected combinations show
positive benefits, and the benefits are gradually increasing.On the other hand, we divide the plants into sensitive types and drought-tolerant types, and find that the biomass of sensitive types is more susceptible to fluctuation of drought intensity, while the biomass of drought-tolerant types remain stable under drought, but decrease due to increased competition under sufficient rainfall.

Third, we use the Monte Carlo method to generate two new precipitation distributions with greater and lesser drought frequency and severity, and analyzed four plant species using the previous model. We find that plant biomass remain stable in both conditions, but not in the same amount.

Fourth, we modify the previous model by introducing pollution degree and habitat reduction index, and analyze the changes in the number of four plants again in combination with the actual situation of factory construction. We find that habitat loss has a bigger side effect than pollution, and the combination of the two keeps plant populations lower over time.

Fifth, we conduct sensitivity analysis of some initial parameters of the four plants to explore how these parameters affect the model and simulation experiment.We find that the maximum number of individual plants under ideal conditions has a relatively large effect on the experiment, but it is within the acceptable range. This reflects the robustness of our model.

At last, we optimize the solving method of the model. We use the fourth order Runge-Kutta method to solve the model and get more accurate prediction results. We also use the analysis results to make valuable suggestions on how to improve the viability of plant communities under drought conditions and contribute to environmental governance.

# 3. A Methodology to Simulate Drought-Stricken Plant Communities（2303950）
## 

The study of plant communities in arid areas is an indispensable part of environmental protection. In these regions, annual plants are important components of vegetation, by virtue of their unique characteristics. This paper presents a method of simulation for the growth, competition, and facilitation of annual plants, which can be applied to various circumstances.

To begin with, we establish the Growth Model of annual plants. At first, we determine the relationship between soil water content and the natural growth rate in Logistic Model. Then, we build the differential equation of soil water content, based on the stochastic rainfall model. 

Finally, we establish the law of annual plant reproduction. To estimate the statistical parameters in the stochastic rainfall model, we use Normal Equation to get the optimal parameters according to Least Square Method.

Based on the Growth Model, we establish the Competition Model of various plants to simulate their root competition. For the competition coefficient in Lotka-Volterra Model, we innovatively determine its relationship with root growth and water-utilizing capacity of plants. Considering the structure of root system, we estimate the parameters in the model reasonably.

Based on the Competition Model, we further establish the Facilitation Model of shrub plants to herbaceous plants. Given the water-lifting action of shrub plants, we modify the water absorption rate in the Competition Model. So far, our models have been elaborated and the parameters have been estimated properly.

After that, we use the fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm to give numerical solutions to the differential equations. And the problems in the Requirement have been solved as follows:

Based on the results from our TOPSIS model, at least eight plant species are required to provide overall benefits for the community. As the number of plant species grows, the scale of the community will decrease, while the community will embrace better stability.

By improving the water absorption efficiency of herbaceous plants, shrubs can reduce the interspecific competition, make the average biomass of different herbaceous plants close to each other, and improve the stability of biodiversity.

Under more severe drought conditions provided in Section 5.4, the scale of the community will be decreased by over 67% and the fluctuation of the evolution will be enlarged by over 36%. But these indexes still follow the similar trend in Section 5.2 as the number of species grows regardless of different weather cycles.

The effects of two typical types of pollutants are compared. The results show that pollutants such as acid rain are more dangerous because it can decrease the scale by 14.6% and increase the fluctuation by 14.4% at the same time. Also, the diminishment of habitat by 50% will cause the system to lose 22.9% of its scale but reduce 8.7% of its fluctuation.

Based on our model and analysis, our strategies are expressed from two main aspects：the Preservation and Modification of the ecosystem.

Finally, the sensitivity and stability of the model are fully analyzed.

# 4. The Warriors against Drought: Plant Communities（2309229）
## 

As the severe drought increases since the global warming, many plant communities die out for lack of water, while others can recover after drought. To explore this phenomenon, we develop GIID model to describe the response of communities to drought and analyse whether species diversity can help communities withstand drought.

Before all the models are established, we select five typical plant species and classifiy them into three categories, according to their inherent growth rate and optimum soil moisture. In addition, we estimate the parameters used in our models.

For Task 1: To simulate plant growth and interspecific competition, we first developed the Lotka-Volterra competition model. Then, considering optimum soil moisture of each species, we set the environmental capacity of them as a function of soil moisture. Finally, we modeled the soil moisture variation to describe the interaction between plants and the environment. We consider the water absorption by plants, irregular rainfall, and other factors. We summarize these analysis and devise our GIID model. Then, we verify the correctness ofmodel. The results are shown in Figure 7.

For Task 2: First, we do the qualitative analysis and find that the Five Species Community is more stable in drought. To quantify how the community benefits from the species diversity, we calculate total biomass, coefficient of variation of total biomass, and S-W index to evaluate the vigor, stability, and evenness of the ecosystem respectively. The experimental results show that as the number of species increases, the total biomass of the community increases and then decreases, while the stability and evenness keep increasing. Besides, two species are required for the community to benefit. The results are shown in Figure 10 to 13.

For Task 3: To explore the effect of species type, we choose three typical species combinations and each combination is simulated separately. We find that combinations with moderate differences in optimum soil moisture increase the total biomass and stability of the community. And if the differences in optimum soil moisture of species are too small or too
large, the community would not benefit.

For task 4: We adjust the magnitude and frequency of droughts, and the experiment results show that: when droughts become stronger and more frequent, the complementary effect among species also becomes stronger. And the biomass of the community increases as the number of species increases. When droughts are less frequent, the competition among species is stronger, and the increase in the number of species lead to decrease in total biomass. The increase in the number of species always enhances community stability.

For Tasks 5 and 6: We attributed the effects of habitat loss and environmental pollution to the decrease in environmental capacity. So we set up a step function to simulate this process. We find that habitat loss and environmental pollution will lead to decrease in total community biomass, while multi species community will still have high stability in this process. Next, we illustrate the measures to ensure the long-term viability of the community. We also describe the impact of the community on the environment based on above findings.

Finally, we change the plant competition intensity, water absorption rate and climate patterns in order to perform sensitivity analysis on these parameters. We find that our model is sensitive to all of them. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the model and discuss how to improve it.

# 5. Dry or Die? Drought-Stricken Plant Communities Can Survive!（2316994）
## 

Under climate change, there will probably be an increase in inter-annual variability in precipitation regimes and more intense and frequent extreme weather and climate events, including multi-year droughts. Therefore, it’s necessary to focus on the drought adaptability of plant community. Our team build the following mathematical model to explore the responsive mechanism of plant community to drought in this paper.

Firstly, to consider the influence of plants’ interspecific interactions, we have improved on the classical model Lotka-Volterra Model by adjusting the equation between two species to multispecies differential equations based on Logistic Equation. We use Spearman Correlation Analysisto get the coefficients to measure the interaction between different species. When the distribution of two species is positively correlated, we believe that the two species are mutually beneficial to a certain extent.

Then, we consider the impact of environmental factors. Collecting the weather data for the past 15 years, we fit the linear relationship between precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture. We also define a environmental impact factor Q, adding it to the basic differential equations. Then We use the computer to set up temperature and precipitation and control changing period to simulate irregular weather cycles. The stochastic simulation is based on real data and can be adjusted artificially. By this model we predict the change trend of plant communities over time.

Next, by measuring the Shannno-Wiener index and ICV (the reciprocal of variation coefficient of species’ biomass), we get specific quantitative indicators for the drought adaptability of plant community. We calculate the change rates of the two indexes of plant communities after a period of time under different situations. Measuring each community with different species from 2 to 7, We find that the minimal number of plant species is 5 if the community want to benefit from this biodiversity. The more species, the better drought adaptability of community.

Furthermore, we further analyze potential impact of more complex environment to make our model more complete and comprehensive. We take the habitat reduction, environmental pollution, and climate warming into consideration. For each factor, we draw the biomass of species changing curve over time to intuitively show the influence of this factor.

Finally, we use Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) Model to assess the importance of each factor. We obtain four weight indicators as 0.257, 0.543, 0.131, and 0.069 for the number of species, the types of species, the weather cycles, and other environmental factors. These indicators help us to better analyze the ways to ensure the long-term viability of a plant community. The larger the indicators, the more it takes precedence over other factors that we need to pay more attention to it.

# 6. Drought Tolerance of a Plant Community under Multi-species Interaction（2321860）
## 

Drought conditions have a significant effect on plant growth, and different species respond differently to drought. Population interactions in communities can affect the evolution of communities under drought conditions. To study the response of plant communities to drought under multi-species interactions, we used population density, biomass, net primary production (NPP) and soil water content as four evaluation indicators, and integrated the effects of precipitation, evaporation, inter-species interactions, pollution and habitat reduction on plant communities.

Based on the traditional Logistic model, we modified the growth rate term, the maximum environmental holding capacity and the water use efficiency in it, and added an interspecific interaction term. Specifically, a Soil water content model was constructed, and applied to the above three terms (taking into account the drought stress threshold response); an Interspecies interaction model was constructed by analyzing the competition between two plants and applied to multiple populations in the community; the interspecific interaction term was added to the population density model and corrected. After establishing the Population density model, we used the Michaelis-Menten equation to construct the Biomass model from population density and then calculate the net primary productivity (NPP) per unit area of the community. Our fitting results were close to the real values, demonstrating the plausibility of our model.

To explore the effects of various irregular weather cycles on plant communities, we simulated three different precipitation patterns, and used our model to predict four indicators mentioned above. It was found that a moderate, steady humidity is conducive to the growth of plants, and high drought tolerant plants adapt better in dry environment.

To explore the long-term effects of species richness and different species varieties on communities, we chose species from different group combinations (categorized by drought tolerance), and calculated the average total NPP under each species number. We found that when there are at least four species, the plant community shows higher resistence to irregular weather cycles, but the impact was smaller under greater level of drought. Moreover, plants that are less resistent to drought contribute more NPP in a community.

To explore the effects of pollution and habitat reduction on plant communities, we added new factors to the population density model, modified the model to predict changes in total NPP of the plant community under natural precipitation in the area.

Finally, based on these conclusions, we offered suggestions for the conservation of the plant communities and discussed the impact of these measures on wider environment.

# 7. Is There Space for More? A Spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations Model for Plant Growth During Drought Cycles（2322687）
## 

Droughts pose a significant risk to the survival of a community of plants. Although individual plants may struggle to adapt to a lack of water caused by a drought, existing literature has suggested a positive relationship between the biodiversity of a plant community and its ability to survive drought cycles. We have been tasked to verify this claim and build a generalized biome-independent model that predicts changes in a plant community through cycles of drought.

Our approach was to develop a parameterized partial differential equations model for the growth of multiple plant species over time on the basis of the amount of water available. Crucially, we also incorporate spatial dimensions and analysisinto the model, which allows us to consider plant dispersal and water diffusion across physical boundaries. To support this growth model, we also implement a sub-model for rainfall that can simulate the effect of a variety of droughts by changing drought timing and severity. Incorporating this into the plant growth model, we model plant growth in Mathematica using numerical analysis of the partial differential equations. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the model’s parameters, simulating the effects of biodiversity by steadily increasing the number of unique species starting from a control of just one species. We also analyze the impact of different types of droughts, as well as different types of plants as measured by their resistance and resilience. We conclude by studying the impacts of external factors, such as pollution or habitat reduction.

Ultimately, we find that although increasing the number of unique plants in a given community generates inter-species competition, it cumulatively benefits the overall system by increasing the total amount of long-term plant biomass. However, marginal benefit decreases as total number of unique species increases: going from one to two unique species generates significant benefits in total biomass, but changes are smaller when going from two to three, and the transition from three to four actually decreases total biomass. Meanwhile, our sensitivity analysis finds that changes in resilience and resistance correspondingly impact total plant biomass but do not affect the general behavior of the model. In addition, we determine that habitat destruction can cause individual species to dominate a plant community due to increased spatial competition. We find under certain extreme conditions, a given species of plants can either survive and dominate in the long-term or go extinct depending on their initial conditions.

The main advantage of our unique spatial approach over traditional, space-independent models that only depend upon time, like the classic Lotka-Volterra model, is the the ability to account for fundamental physical behaviors of plants and ground water—that is, dispersal and diffusion across a 2D space. Without spatial considerations, one cannot accurately model the fact that generally, plants and water can only spread to adjacent locations. This also allows us to model phenomenon like competition for habitation or water at a given location. Finally, the spatial approach also provides the ability to simulate random initial locations, mirroring the stochasticity of real-world environments, as well as forecast the impacts of habitat reduction easily. Combined with a realistic model for rainfall data and drought conditions, our model serves as a comprehensive general phenomenological model for simulating plant growth in any given community under cycles of droughts.
